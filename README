# AWS Client

## Backstory
We have to keep our AWS dependencies in a separate repo becuase our build process OOMs when attempt to include the assets in the main repo. See more details [here](https://projecttools.nordicsemi.no/jira/browse/IRIS-921)

## Building
```bash
# production
npm run buildproduction

# dev
npm run builddev

# both
npm run build
```

## Usage 
The built assets are intended to be used in the [the Iris Frontend project](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrfcloud-web-frontend). 
After you've built them, move the files to `dist/aws-wrapper.min.js`.
